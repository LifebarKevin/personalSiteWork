		<h3>Welcome.</h3>
		<p>I designed and developed this website in pursuit of a change from Operation IT into a more creative role. I want to be a part of the medium that shapes our digital world.I am an artist that started fostering my curiosity in coding.</p>
		<p>I will be updating this site periodically as I research, discover, and tinker with new possibilities and concepts.<p> 
		<p>So please, look at this as a personal/interactive résumé.</p>
		<h5>Experience</h5>
		<h6>Founder of OwlhelpIT</h6>
		<p>I currently operate a private IT consulting practice where I provide professional services to small businesses and assist individuals with any ideas they have. I believe that eveyrone deserves the same professional IT guy that companies have.</p>  
		<p>One of my next projects is to work on getting a site up for OwlHelpIT using BootStrap to gain experience with that framework.</p>
		<h6>IT Admin for Sinu</h6>
		<p>I am an IT Amidnistator for a global MSP. There, I handle operational IT for all of Sinu's clientel. My tasks here have mainly been: planning, documentation, remedial IT tasks and implemtation. I have also had the opportunity to do some coding with development of email signatures, lite website editing work and identifying where errors with some sites lie.</p> 
		<h6>IT Manager at DOOR3</h6>
		<p>DOOR3 was my first real look at website development. It was here that my interest started and I began my journey in coding. I began coding here in between my duties as the single point of contact for any IT related tasks for 90+ employees worldwide. I would handle everything from global DNS, Proxies, VM's, Domain managment, tunnels, documentation and administrative duties, to simple troubleshooting with desktop applications.</p>
		<h5>Education</h5>
		<h6>General Assembly</h6>
		<p>In wanting to cement my experience and knowledge in Front End Web Development I enrolled in a part time course.</p>
